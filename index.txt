<h1><b>Life's Best Memories</b></h1>

<h2><b>Description of Website</b></h2>

<h4><b>This website is a website about the best memories that I have captured through a camera lens during my interaction with the world.</b></h4>

<h2>HIGH JUMP</h2>
<p> In these photographs from High jump, I have captuered moments of when me and friends are having fun at Latin School of Chicago, on field trips, labs, and being together as a family in cohort 26.

High Jump's mission: <em>"High Jump equalizes access to education for middle school students who have exhibited academic ambition and potential and who are of limited economic means."</em>

<h4><b>From: Adam Sondag, 

You've done a lot of cool work this semester and I think you've learned a lot. You're a very smart kid. Not many kids your age think about building things and putting ideas together the way you do. It's been a lot of fun working with you and I'm excited to get your final site put together to show off to everyone</b></h4>
